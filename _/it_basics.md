(Topic-1) Introduction to IT Basics
Information Is Important
<gun.png>
Most of the fictional characters above need no introduction.
All of us had a favourite childhood game, where we pretended to be one of them!
What made them so very cool was that they always seemed to know everything.
The information they possessed made them, their employers, and their governments more powerful.

Information Means Power
<info.png>
In exactly the same way, having information on various topics keeps us one step ahead of the game.
Whether as an individual, a company or a community, we are better prepared to take smarter decisions, if we know the current trends, the latest news and past occurrences and consequences of a problem.

What is `Information Technology`
Our manic need for information did not always exist, though.
With time, along with the growth in numbers, wants, capabilities and demands, our need for information has increased at an exponentially high rate.
Today, information is available on diverse topics, and each titbit enables us in myriads of ways. It has become one of our fundamental needs.
Using computers or computer systems to manage all this information is called Information Technology.

Definition Of Information Technology
Let’s look at the definition of Information Technology (IT) .
The Oxford Dictionary says that IT is: ‘ The study, or use, of computer systems for storing, retrieving or sending information’.
It’s no secret that computers are at the very heart of the IT framework, lending the term ‘technology’ to Information Technology.
They are used to create, store, retrieve and transmit data or information across large distances, thus they have become indispensable to our 21st century lives.

Let's Do This!
To understand Information Technology, we need to take a closer look at its biggest enabler, and paradoxically, its biggest limitation today. Let’s take a closer look at this lovable box

(Topic-2) What Is A Computer?
Why Do We Need Computers?
<comp.png>
We built computers to expand our brains.
Modern times meant complex problems with complex solutions. We needed help.

Computers Are Our Best Buds
<comp_buds.png>
Computers gave us a way to store, retrieve and process data.
Computers process data and carry out complex calculations within a few seconds.
They can also be connected to a network making it possible to share information over large distances.
The Point: Computers are indispensable to us today.

How Do Computers Work?
<comp_workings.png>
A computer is an electronic device that can receive information, perform actions on the basis of rules and provide an output.
Using these functions a computer can access, store, process and relay information to its user within seconds!
You can think of a computer as a black box.
It accepts data, makes changes to it, based on certain conditions, and displays the result.

My Computer Understands Me
<comp_binary.png>
Computers understand everything in combinations of 0s and 1s, but also know how to build complex things out of them. This is called Binary Code.
For example
Computers are able to convert these 0s and 1s to mean various things such as in a game, a web page and even the application you are using at this very moment.

(Topic-3) Pioneers Of Computing
Pioneers Of Computing
<comp_pioneers.png>
Rome Wasn’t Built in a Day Nor was the computer!
So who set things moving? Let’s look at some dead famous contributors

The First Calculator
<comp_first_calculator.png>
One of the first computing machines known was the Abacus. It was used in Europe, as well as Asia, around the 15th Century.

Blaise Pascal
In 1642, Blaise Pascal invented the Pascaline, which was a mechanical calculator.

Leibniz
<comp_pacscal_machine.png>
Almost 30 years later, Gottfried Von Leibniz took things a step further. He called it the Stepped Reckoner.
Pascal’s machine could do multiplications, divisions and find square roots!

Charles Babbage
<comp_charles_barbage.png>
Then, the early 1800s, Charles Babbage made history by building The Difference Engine.
The world now had a machine that mechanised a whole series of complex calculations and provided an output. He is called the Father of the Computer.
One of the most remarkable things is that this machine had a memory. Here, data could be held temporarily for later use.
It dwarfed any computing device then in existence.

Alan Turing
<comp_turing_machine.png>
The Turing Machine was the first incarnation of the modern day computer.
Built in 1936, it consisted of a long magnetic tape that had a combination of symbols, a sensor head that could read the tape and write symbols to the tape, and a set of simple instructions that directed the head to read and change the symbols on the tape.
A computer that we would recognise today works on the same theory as the Turing Machine, but is much more complex.
However, whether we talk of the simple computers built by Babbage and Turing, or the complex computer you are reading this on right now, the idea remains the same.
Accept input, add value to it by processing and then deliver a result.

Bravo!
That was great!
Moving on to the next topic…

(Lesson-2) Computers Through The Ages
(Topic-1) History of Computers
Welcome Back!
<welcome.png>
It’s great to see you again!
Now that we know what a computer is, let’s see how we got from something as simple as a calculator to the complex beauty of the mobile phone.

Computer Generations
<comp_evolve.png>
Just like us, computers had stages of evolution too.
They are called ‘Generations of Computers’.
Each is classified based on the kind of technology used to build them, which means there are altogether five (5) generations of computer.

First Generation: Vacuum Tubes
<comp_first_gen.png>
The first computers were built around 1946 and were huge!
This is because they used Vacuum Tubes.
Vacuum tubes were glass tubes with the air removed, creating a vacuum. They contained electrodes and were used as a switch or amplifier.
Vacuum tubes produced a lot of heat and took up a lot of space. So first generation computers were expensive to maintain and slow, compared to those models that evolved later.

Second Generation: Transistors
<comp_2nd_gen.png>
The second generation began in 1959 with the use of transistors instead of vacuum tubes. This made them cheaper, consume less power, more compact in size and more reliable.
This made them cheaper, consume less power, more compact in size and more reliable.
Primary and secondary memory were distinguished and high level programming languages were used. (Both these concepts will become clear in the next few units, so stick with it!)

Third Generation : Integrated Circuits
<comp_3rd_gen.png>
In 1965, the third generation of computers began with integrated circuits built into them. This made computers drastically more compact in size, as well as more reliable and efficient.
For the first time, users could interact with the computer using a keyboard and a monitor! This was amazing progress!

Fourth & Fifth Generations: Very Large Scale Integrated Circuits (VLSI) & Ultra Large Scale Integration (ULSI)
<comp_4th_gen.png>
From 1971 onwards, computers began to look like the desktop version we all know and recognize.
The major changes that have happened since then have been increased processing speed and the reduced size of the machines.
Thus today, we have a mobile phone, which is much more powerful than our average laptops or desktops.

What’s next?
<comp_owners.png>
Computers have definitely come a long way since their inception.
The first computers could only be afforded by large corporations that could maintain them.
Now any individual might own multiple computers and in many cases, does!

(Topic-2) Types of Computers
Types of Computers
A wide variety of computers exists. Most of the computers we see, on a day to day basis, are mobile phones, tablets, laptops and in some cases desktops.
All these are essentially the same kind of computer, called a Personal Computer or a PC. There are also other types of computers and setups. These include:
1. Workstation
2. Minicomputer
3. Mainframe
4. Supercomputer
Let’s look at each of them in detail.

The PC
<comp_pc.png>
The PC or Personal Computer is literally meant for personal, or an individual's,use.
They are complete with all of the components being part of the same unit.
The best examples of this are a desktop, a laptop, a mobile phone or a tablet.

A Workstation
<comp_work_station.png>
Workstations are similar to personal computers. They too are standalone machines meant for individual use.
However, as the name suggests, they are used usually at the workplace and come with high processing and storage capabilities.

A Minicomputer
<comp_mini_computer.png>
A Minicomputer is larger than a personal computer with much higher processing power. It can support and process work from around 250 users simultaneously. It is usually used as a shared resource in a small network.

A Mainframe Computer
<comp_mainframe.png>
A Mainframe computer is a large and expensive computer. It can manage thousands of users simultaneously. It is used by companies for bulk operations like data capture and management, and to support large applications.

A Supercomputer
<comp_super_computers.png>
Supercomputers are the fastest computers available today. They are very expensive and are used for large applications that require immense amount of calculations.

Evolve
<comp_evolve_0.png>
It does go without saying that today, we use computers constantly and are unable to function without them.
We might as well re-edit “The March of Progress’
Computers today are smarter than most of us and we are building them to become smarter still.
Okay! Time to Revise!

Computers have evolved over the years, but their generations are not defined by time. They are defined based on:
Select the right answer
`Who made them`
`The technology they are built on`
`How good they looked after building`

We’ll see just what they are made of!
See you there!


(Lesson-3) What's Inside My Computer
(Topic-1) How Does The Computer Work?
<welcome.png>
Welcome Back!
Lovely to see you back!
This time we will be looking at what things computers are made of.
Here goes!

Mirror Mirror
<comp_snowhite.png>
All of us have heard the famous fairytale of Snow White. The Queen, being jealous of Princess Snow White’s beauty, plots to kill her.

We Have A Magic Mirror Too
The Evil Queen had a Magic Mirror, which she always asked, ‘Who is the fairest in the land?”
The Magic Mirror, with its powerful knowledge truthfully answered every time.
Of course, this leads to some minor discomfort for Snow White, but that’s a tale for another time!
However, if you think about it, the Magic Mirror is exactly like a computer!
It listens to the Queen’s question, reaches into its store of knowledge and answers her immediately.

Input Devices
<comp_input_device.png>
A computer, in the same way will ‘listen’ to its user by accepting an instruction. This is called providing an Input.
Input can be given to a computer in a variety of ways. One can do this by typing them out on a keyboard, clicking on something on the screen using a mouse, speaking through a microphone, etc.
Devices through which, we can give instructions to the computer, or interact with it, are called Input Devices.

Output Devices
<comp_output.png>
The Magic mirror spoke back to the Queen. The computer can do that too using its speakers.
But usually it will display its ‘answer’ or results back to us by displaying it on the screen, or executing the command given to it.
This is called the output of the computer. Hence devices used to share output with the user are called Output Devices

Computers Are Complex
<comp_workings_0.png>
So, a computer works something like this:
Nope! Just kidding! :D

Technology Is The Miracle
<comp_workings_1.png>
Between the Input and Output is the crucial step of Processing.
This is where the magic happens!
Processing takes place in the Central Processing Unit or the CPU. The CPU uses the instructions, given to it by the user, along with the stored instructions in its memory to give a result.

Technology Is The Miracle
<comp_workings_0.png>
You could say that the CPU, along with the memory units, make up the Processing stage in the working of a computer.
So let’s correct that diagram above, this is what it means!


(Topic-2) Basic Components Of A Computer
Basic Components of a Computer
<comp_components.png>
Components of the Processing Stage looks something like this:
As mentioned earlier, The CPU is the main component of the computer that performs calculations, actions and runs programs. It is called the Brain of the computer.

Units
<comp_units.png>
The CPU further consists of the Control Unit (CU), the Arithmetical and the Logical Unit (ALU).
The ALU Performs all the calculations and logical operations of the computer, manipulating numbers in a structured and purposeful way.
As we have learnt, computers understand instructions in combinations of 0s and 1s. Since everything is expressed in numbers, the Arithmetic and Logical Unit becomes crucial.

Control Unit
<comp_control_unit.png>
Next up is the Control Unit.
The Control Unit directs and controls the operation of the processor. It constantly communicates with the ALU, the memory and the Input/Output devices telling them what to do.
The CU reads and interprets instructions.
It controls information flow from various devices of the computer and regulates the timing of the processor’s working.
This little beauty handles multiple tasks of fetching, decoding, executing and storing results and, is obviously indispensable to the working of a computer.

Storage & Memory
<comp_storage_mem.png>
Now we know where the computer keeps its brain. Can you guess where it keeps its knowledge?
There are 2 kinds of memory in a computer, `Primary memory` and `Secondary memory`.

Storage & Memory Continued
<comp_storage_mem_0.png>
The Secondary Storage is the unit where all the computer’s data and instructions are stored. This is the permanent memory containing data and programs.It is rewritable.

There is another memory called `ROM (Read Only Memory)` where essential instructions related to the startup of the computer and other vital functions are stored. It’s not rewritable.

From the ROM and the Storage, everything required for immediate use is copied and stored in the Memory section. This Memory Is temporary and is called the RAM (Random Access Memory).

Example
<comp_storage_mem_1.png>
To make the working of a computer clearer, let’s look at an example.
Retrace your steps to a few minutes ago when you turned your attention to your device and clicked on the icon to open this application. What was just a click or a tap for you meant a whole lot more to your computer!

Example Continued…
Once you clicked on the icon, your job was done. From here your computer took over.
- The input device of your machine registered a click and sent the information along with the location of the click to the processor.
- The processor referred to its memory to check which program is represented by the little picture (icon) in that section of the screen.
- It then found the name of the program and loaded it to the temporary memory from the permanent storage.
- It read and interpreted the code for this application. Then, it followed the instructions telling it how to display the images and text on your screen to represent the opened application.
All this happened within a few seconds in the wondrous device that is your computer.

See You Soon
We now know what the term Information Technology means, what computers are and how they were developed over the years and what’s inside them. We have also learnt how computers function.
Now we need to look at these machines at a deeper level to understand them even better.
Let’s speed off to the next milestone!

(Lesson-5) What's Inside My Computer _ A Closer Look
(Topic-1) Inside The CPU
A Closer Look
<comp_look.jpg>
In the previous unit we learnt a bit about types of computers and got a general idea of how a computer works.
In this unit we are going to get to understand the computer better.

This Unit Is About the CPU & Memory
The computer’s brain is the CPU and as we know, it is made up of the ALU and the CU. All the computation happens by using a combination of these components and the Memory.
In the coming screens we will be focusing on the CPU, its components, along with the Memory and its workings.

The ALU
Let’s begin with the Arithmetic and Logic Unit.
It is the mathematical brain of the computer and a thing of beauty!
It is made up of 2 sections. The Arithmetic section and the Logical one.
Each section contains complex electrical circuits based on which Arithmetic operations (Add, Subtract, Multiply and Divide) and Logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) are carried out.
Upon direction from the CU, the correct circuit is employed to perform the operation.

The ALU Continued
<comp_alu.png>
Overall the ALU looks something like above.
A and B are values which the operations are to be done on. C represents a space that is created in the memory to store the result of the operation.
The values A and B are sent from the Memory to the ALU along with data regarding which operation is to be performed.
The ALU accepts A and B, executes the instruction and saves the answer in C. This answer can now be shared with the user by using the output devices of the computer.

The Control Unit
<comp_orchestra.png>
Next up is the Control Unit (CU).
The job of the control unit is to ensure that all the components are performing the correct operations.
The CU reads and understands the instructions. Then it sends inputs and directions to the various other components to do the actual processing.
The Control Unit is the Conductor of the Orchestra!

The Control Unit Continued
<comp_control_unit_0.png>
Instructions can be fetched from the secondary memory or can come directly from the user. These are loaded into the memory sequentially, like the steps in the diagram.
From here each line of instructions is first decoded and then the execution begins.
Directions are given to the processing components of the computer.
For example A and B are being sent to the ALU and the Memory is being asked to create space to store the resulting value C.


(Topic-2) Computer Storage
Secondary Storage
<comp_storage_secondary.jpg>
The computer has a section called Storage to store data, programs and files.
When required, this information is searched for and pulled from the permanent storage. It is replicated inside the temporary storage called the RAM (Memory).
It is replicated inside temporary storage called the RAM (Memory).
From here, each sequential instruction is loaded into the CU, which then executes it.

ROM
<comp_storage_primary.jpg>
There is a section of memory called the ROM. It is a permanent memory containing vital instructions. These too are loaded into the temporary memory for execution.
There are different types of ROM. Some are hard wired and cannot be changed like the MROM or Masked ROM. Others like The Programmable ROM (PROM), Erasable and Programmable ROM (EPROM) and the Electrically Erasable and Programmable ROM(EEPROM) can be modified once or multiple times.

Registers
<comp_storage_register.jpg>
There is another type of small memory in the computer known as a register.
The CPU as a whole contains multiple registers in order to:
1. Fetch: Fetch Data from one component like the Memory and post it to another component like the CU.
2. Decode: Interpret instructions.
3. Execute: Executing register usually help in storing and transferring the results of operations performed by the CPU.
Think of registers as little helpers that run around doing small but crucial work.

A Short Summary Of Storage
Thus there are different things a computer needs to remember and understand in order to carry out each and every task.
1. Secondary Storage consisting of programs, data and files, usually in the form of a disk drive.
2. Primary storage or volatile storage including the RAM and registers.
3. ROM made up of permanent vital instructions that need to be used from time to time.

Let’s Revise _ Computer Storage!
We have learnt a lot in this unit!

(Lesson-5) Computers Are Programmable
(Topic-1) What Is A Computer Program
What brings a computer alive?
<comp_1.jpg>
From the previous units of the course, we have learnt what a computer is made of.
Everything we know so far will give us an intact computer, ready for use.
But what really brings a computer alive?
PS: It’s not just electricity!

What Is A Computer Program?
The fundamental use of a computer is to work for us, to carry out our instructions.
The computer will execute exactly as it is instructed to, hence, the task must be explained in a series of detailed steps. So, a computer program, in simple terms, is a list of instructions for the computer to perform.
All the programs used by a computer are collectively called software and all the tangible components of a computer are called hardware.

Can We Talk Directly To A Computer?
<comp_binary.jpg>
We learnt earlier that computers understand everything in the form of 0s and 1s, which is called Binary Code.
However, it is difficult for us humans to write out instructions in Binary Code.

The Perfect Solution
<comp_comfort.jpg>
That’s why a midway solution has been created.
Like the perfect solution giving you complete comfort and ease :D

A Program To Translate
Instructions are written to the computer in a language that is partly English and partly contains connotations understandable by a machine.
This is called a Programming Language.
Since it cannot be directly understood by the computer, it has to be translated into Binary Code before execution.
This translation stage is called Compiling and is done by a program called a Compiler.
What Is A Computer Program Continued…
Compilers did not always exist, as the early programs were written in Machine Language (Binary Code) itself.

A Program To Translate
<comp_bytecodes.jpg>
Just like computers, the programming languages that run on them have evolved too. They are divided into generations to indicate the increasing power of programming styles.
- First Generation: Machine Level Languages (Low level)
- Low Level Language, very close to binary
- Third Generation: High Level Languages that are machine independent.
- Fourth Generation: High Level Language, very similar to English.
- Fifth Generation: High Level contains tools to help develop a program.

Generations 1, 2 & 3
First Generation programming language is a direct example of instructions in Binary.
It is called Machine Level Language.

The Second Generation, is written in a code very similar to machine language and needs to be compiled before use by the computer. It works only for a particular version of a computer.

Third Generation Languages are high level languages. They are machine independent and can be compiled to run on different versions of computers.

Generations 4 & 5
<comp_5th_gen.png>
Fourth Generation Languages are very similar to statements in English and are mostly used in database programming and scripts.

Fifth Generation languages: Contain visual tools to help develop a program.
Commonly used for developing Artificial Intelligence applications, they are based on a set of rules instead of instructions.

(Topic-2) How To Write A Computer Program - Concepts
What is Involved?
<comp_programmer.jpg>
If a task is considered as a list of instructions, the job of a programmer is to develop this list of instructions in a computer language.
The instructions need to direct the computer to manipulate different types of objects like numbers, images, words, sounds, etc.
Sounds like the work of a music composer directing each instrument?
Well, in a way, that’s what a computer programmer is!

Steps Before Writing A Program
Before beginning to write a program, we need to consider what we want the program to do.
1. Identify the problem: what is the task that has to be executed?
2. Identify the user: What is the profile of the person who will use this program?
3. Identify target machine: Which computer will it run on, type, whether iOS, Android, etc?
4. Which language is it best to employ?
The fourth step will be much clearer once the first 3 are done.

Task: Drink A Glass of Water
If you were to tell your friend to drink a glass of water, what would you say?
Probably “Drink some water”.
Now consider that this friend of yours is actually a robot.
Does your statement alter slightly? What if your robot friend asks you what do you mean by ‘drink’?’
You would have to be more specific wouldn’t you?

Example1
So let’s try to be clearer. Let’s say to the robot,
1. Get up from where you are sitting and go to the kitchen.
2. Pick up a glass from the 3rd shelf, using one hand.
3. Pick up the jug of water with another hand.
4. Pour water from the jug into the glass until the glass is full.
5. Bring the glass near to your mouth, tilt it and swallow the water.
That’s better! …...isn’t it?

Task : Perfect?
<robot.jpg>
Not really!
Example 2
Because now, our robot friend is standing in the kitchen, still trying to drink water from an empty glass and the jug is still in his hand.
Remember a computer will do exactly as you say, and nothing more or less!

Example 2 Another part...
<robot.jpg>
It could be argued that writing a computer program is as much an art as it is a skill.
Let’s try again.
The objective of your code is to make your robot move one step to its right.

Example2 Continued
Instructions:
1. Get ready to move
2. Pick up your right leg and place it 30cm to the right of your current position, along a linear path
3. Now move your left leg and place it next to your right, assuming your original pose.
4. Say the words ‘I have moved to my right’.
5. Stop executing.
Now this is more like it!

Noteworthy!
It’s interesting to note here, that the robot must already know what ‘Right Leg’ means, how far 30cm is and what a linear path looks like, etc
Details like these need to be stored in the computer’s memory, just like we learnt in the previous unit.
The writing of a program will be explored in greater detail in the advanced course!
Until then let’s revise!

(Lesson-7) Computer Networks
(Topic-1) Network Topologies & LAN/WAN/MAN
What We Know So Far
<animated_comprogram.gif>
To track our progress along our journey, we now know a lot about what a computer is, what it is made up of and how it works.
In the last unit we saw that computers do exactly what people tell them to, workloads are eased and everything moves along just fine.

Resource Sharing
As computers became more compact, they were produced in large numbers and gradually they became cheaper in the market.
Pretty soon companies and workspaces had multiple computing devices. It then became useful to share data and resources amongst a network of machines.
It was cheaper to have a large, shared storage drive and have one common printer among multiple computer systems.

Connecting People
<comp_connect.png>
This is how the first Computer Networks came into existence around the 1960s.
During that time, they existed mainly to allow the sharing of data and resources within a single workspace.
A Computer network, basically is a group of two or more computing devices, connected using a telecommunications network, allowing them to share data and resources.
Just like telephone networks, the central idea is to connect people to one another.

Local Area Network
<comp_connect_0.png>
A small network of computers, geographically close together is called a Local Area Network or LAN.
A LAN could mean a few computers in a room or a university campus with thousands of computers connected together.
One of the first examples of a sizeable network was the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) network, set up by the Military in North America.

Ethernet
The most successful technology created for networks was the Ethernet,
The Ethernet LAN setup had multiple computers connected via a common Ethernet cable.
Whenever a computer had to share data with another computer, it would write the message onto the cable.
The messages sent from one computer to another were visible to all computers.
Hence they were appended with a unique name so that only the computer that the message was meant for, would process it. (Kind of like the chits we used to pass in class!)
This unique name was actually an address, called the Media Access Control (MAC) Address.

How Does An Ethernet Connection Work
<comp_ethernet.png>
A computer wanting to send a message to another, over an Ethernet connection, needs to check if the line is free, and then begin to transmit.
This works well if the network is small and there is less traffic.
As more computers across the network attempt to talk to each other more frequently, the chances of the line being occupied at any given time, are higher.

Network Collision
<comp_network_collision_0.png>
If 2 or more machines attempt to transmit across the same line simultaneously, the messages get corrupted.
This is called collision. In the case of the collision of multiple messages, the network detects it and discards all the messages.

Wait Time Over A Network
<comp_network_collision.png>
So, a method was developed to avoid this.
It was decided that a computer would first check if the line was free and only then transmit. Otherwise it would wait until the line was free.

But again, if many computers waited and then as soon as they found the line free, they jumped in to transmit, then it would again cause a collision.

Example
So, to solve this doozy, it was decided that each computer that found the line was busy would wait for a different amount of time that would increment.

Example Continued
Consider that computers A and B both want to transmit data along the shared line.
- If A finds the line busy, it will wait for 2 seconds and try again
- On the second try if the line is still busy, it will wait for 4 seconds.
- If busy after 4 seconds, it will wait for 8 and so on.
- Computer B’s waiting intervals are 1.5 seconds.
- So if both computers find the line busy, B will check at the 1.5th second, find it free and begin to transmit.
- If B is done transmitting in half a second, computer A which checks at the 2nd second can proceed, or else it will wait for 4 seconds and try again.

This frees up the network and helps to avoid collisions. This increasing wait time is called Exponential Backoff.

Example 2
<comp_network_1.png>
That solution evolved further.
Small clusters of computers would share a wire, and then clusters would collectively share a wire.

If A had to send a message to B, C or D it would not need to occupy the whole main cable. It could do so within its own section. Only if messages needed to be seen between such clusters would the main shared resource be occupied.


(Topic-2) Network Topologies & LAN/WAN/MAN

Network Topologies
Further evolutions of the idea created different tried and tested network topologies for different types, and sizes, of networks.
Bus topology:
This is the simplest and the original one.
There is one main cable and each computer is connected to it.

Network Topologies
Star Topology
<comp_network_topology.png>
In this, the computers are connected to one central system which is responsible for transmitting data among them.
A lot depends on this star!

Network Topologies Continued
Ring Topology:
As the name suggests, the computers are connected in a continuous circuit, with each computer connected to the next.

Network Topologies Continued
Ring Topology:
<comp_circuit.png>
As the name suggests, the computers are connected in a continuous circuit, with each computer connected to the next.

Tree Topology
<comp_circuit_tree.png>
Mostly, combinations of a few types of arrangements were used to set up networks.
There are 2 others called Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) and Wide Area Network(WAN).

LAN, MAN, WAN
All the networks we have discussed so far have been LAN networks.
A MAN is larger than a LAN and can cover an entire city.
A WAN is the largest and is used to set up a network over large geographic distances.

Why were computers connected in networks?
Select the right answer

(Lesson-6) The Internet
(Topic-1) What is the Internet?
We Have It Good
Today, just by using a few keys on a computer, we can read articles, ‘meet’ our friends and family, living far away, through a video call and have food delivered to our doorstep.
What’s more, we have become so accustomed to using the Internet, we no longer bat an eyelid at any of these wonders it offers!
You would agree, that our ability to send and receive information over a global telecommunications network has forever changed our world.

Networks Had to Happen
<comp_internet.png>
Once computers became more compact and cheaper to make, the world of personal computing became accessible.
An obvious next step was to harness it to aid one of the most fundamental needs of human beings. The need to communicate.

Networks Had to Happen Continued
<comp_internet_0.png>
The size of networks grew from a single room to the whole city, then to many cities and finally breached the borders of countries.
The biggest computer network that connects the entire world together, has come to be known as the Internet.

Internetwork Communication.
<comp_internet_1.png>
The internet, literally is a series of connections between multiple smaller networks. Thus the name Internet, as it allows Internetwork communications.
In order to make communication smoother, certain standard protocols have been defined for data transfer.

Let’s Get Learning
You are at present connected to the Internet, where you are accessing data from our Programming Hub servers to learn more about the Internet.
Isn’t that cool? :D
Even if that sentence is not 100% clear, I can assure you, we are moving forward ;)
Let’s leap right in!

You Are A Little Dot On The Internet
To access this application right now, your first connection is probably a LAN, which is all the devices connected to your WiFi router.
This is then connected to a WAN that might span your city or town and, which belongs to your Internet Service Provider (ISP) at the regional level.
That router in turn may connect to an even bigger WAN that represents your country. There might be more connections, but you will eventually be connected to the backbone of the internet.
The backbone consists of giant routers with super high capacity connections.

Data Travels A Huge Physical Distance
<comp_internet_2.png>
Now, every time you click on a link or request a video, the data representing this, makes the journey to the backbone of the network.
It travels along the backbone and then completes the journey to your machine.
Yes. This happens every single time.

(Topic-2) How Is Data Transferred Across The Internet?
Example
<comp_data_transfer.png>
To understand this better, think of the data as a product you have ordered online, being delivered to you.

Example Continued
<comp_data_transfer_0.png>
1. The product is first picked up from the seller
2. Taken to a storage hub close to the seller
3. Transported to another storage hub closest to you
4. From where it begins its final journey to your address
There might be many more stages with multiple emails being sent to you at each stage, but you get the picture right?
Each stage in the journey of your data is called a Hop.

Example
To continue the example, consider you and your neighbour both order something at the same time, except, your neighbour’s parcel is huge!
Both parcels arrive at your apartment building at the same time.
However, since your neighbour’s parcel is much bigger than yours, that delivery boy decides to use the lift first.
Both, you and your neighbour ordered at the same time but you had to wait longer to receive your order because the route to your house was occupied.

What Is A Data Packet?
<comp_data_packet.png>
The same thing can happen across a network.

What Is A Data Packet Continued
A small message going to someone may have to wait for a long time if the line is busy with a large file transfer.
This is why transmission messages are chopped up into equal sized segments called packets.
These packets then make individual journeys to the destination, using different routes through the network.
Deciding which path each packet should take so as to reach its destination quickly is called routing and is done by routers at each network hop.

Networks Had To Happen
But how do the routers know where the data needs to be sent?
Networks Had To Happen
<comp_network_data_where.png>
Just like across a simple LAN connection, each message or each packet contains a destination address so that routers know where to forward them.
The format for this address is defined by the Internet Protocol (IP) and hence is called the IP address.
As we know already, each computer in the network is assigned this unique name called the IP Address. IP Addresses look something like this: 172.16.13.113

Networks Had to Happen
As mentioned in the previous few screens, there exists a standard protocol through which computers communicate with each other across the network.
Just as we use the rules of grammar when we speak, the Internet uses rules of a protocol called the TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) to ensure that interconnected devices can understand each other.

DNS
<comp_dns.png>
Now when your computer is trying to display a website for you, it needs the website’s IP Address to locate and fetch the data.
However, it is tedious to remember a site by their IP Addresses and we would rather type in the name such as ‘google.com’.

DNS
<comp_dns_0.png>
The Domain Name System helps with this by maintaining a registry of website names and their corresponding IP Addresses.
So every time you type the name of a website into your browser, it checks for the name of that website at the DNS server and then proceeds to find the data.

Let's Revise
We have learnt a lot in this module!
> The general setup of the Internet.
> The journey of data to the backbone and from there towards the user.
> Routing, Hops, Packets and how they are useful.
> TCP/IP and DNS.
There is a lot more about the Internet that is eye opening and amazing.
We will go through all these concepts in the Advanced module.

(Lesson-8) Information Security
(Topic-1) Need for Information Security
Information At Our Fingertips
<comp_info_apple.png>
Hi! It’s great to see you back!
We learnt in the previous unit how the Internet has made it possible to access information from anywhere across the world, on any topic under the sun!
This a wonderful development indeed!
But as we know, along with pros, comes cons as well.

Just Google It
<comp_google.png>
Today, we use the internet for absolutely everything. Sometimes it might seem strange, how much we rely on information from people we don’t know at all.
Don’t believe me?

Try It
Try this.
Open up Google on any one of your devices.
Type in ‘How to’ in the search bar.The items in the resulting list should give you a fair idea :D
Jokes aside, we really have begun to share very sensitive data about ourselves, often unthinkingly, across an electronic medium.

Computers Only Execute
<comp_execute.png>
Computers have no ethics.
They simply execute the instructions that are given to them.
So, a computer is unable to distinguish between code that could rob a bank and that which enables a patient’s life support.

The Bad Guys
So, while we interact with so many nameless, faceless entities online, we must remember that not all of them may abide by the rules and most certainly, not all of them will be our friend.
There are people out there who want to access data that was not meant for them. Such people are called Hackers.
Our Facebook status is something we would like people to know. Our bank and credit card passwords are decidedly not!


(Topic-2) Threats & Measures
Threats
There are different kinds of threats that Internet users face. To understand these better, let’s group them up.
> Threat of Secrecy
> Threat of Integrity
> Threat of Availability
Secrecy means that only certain people or entities should have access to certain data. Cases where a user’s bank details or passwords are revealed, is a breach of secrecy

What Are These Threats?
Integrity means that only some people should be able to access and modify certain sets of data.
Example, if someone finds out your Facebook password and posts on Facebook pretending to be you, it is called a breach of integrity.
If multiple requests are sent to a website on purpose, making its servers unable to take the load and thus be unavailable to genuine users who want to access it. This is called an attack of availability.

Measures
<comp_auth.png>
As a precaution against all these threats, we use a two-step process, to ascertain the identity of a user.
Step 1: Authentication
Step 2: Access Control

Authentication
Step 1: Authenticating the user makes sure that the computer is interacting with the correct person by asking users for:
> Passwords: A user is asked to enter a username and password to judge whether he/she is the right person to provide data to.
> Tokens are a bit like a digital key to a digital lock. Included as part of the request for a page, they help to identify that the user is coming from an authentic source.
> Biometrics, as most of us know, has to do with scanning a fingerprint or the retina.

Measures, ACL
Step 2: Access Control
Access control is a mechanism by which the computer knows how much information to reveal to which user.
This is done by using an Access Control List (ACL). It lists out all registered users along with the type of access to be given.
A simple example would be the sales department of a company.
A salesperson logging into the system can see all the sales that he has made during a month.
But a Sales Manager logging in can see all the sales of all his subordinates during that month.

Hi I’m A Hacker
<comp_hack_calls.png>
Let’s take a look at some of the kinds of mischief that hackers get up to.
Often, hackers will try to get into a system by tricking users into revealing their passwords.
These could be calls from people pretending to be from your bank, from your telephone company or even your company’s IT department.
“Hi I’m calling from the server room, we are facing some network issues, could you just open your up your system settings and……..”

What’s the PIN?
Another way is by a brute force attack.
Suppose the hacker needs to guess your 4 digit credit card pin.
He could make the computer do a simple exercise using probability and check each result.
He needs to find out the correct combination of digits, given that each is in the range of 0 to 9.
Do you remember the mathematical formula? Go down memory lane to your school days and you’ll find it right there!
This may seem like a lot of work to check each result. But computers are super awesome and super fast!

Bugs Are Gateways
A common way for hackers to find a bug in the system is gaining access through the internet. This is done by a fair bit of trial and error.
Example: The system or application asks the user to enter a User ID and a Password to authenticate him. Now instead of entering a username, the hacker includes a bit of malicious code. If the creators of the system have not safeguarded against this, the system could be compromised.

An Overview
In this unit, we have merely scratched the surface of Information Security.
There are many more examples and methodologies by which data can be compromised.
Luckily, there are good guys out there too!
They work to make computer systems and the internet more secure.
You could think of them as the Justice League of Cyberspace ;)
We will take a look at some of the best efforts of the good guys, and the bad guys as well, in the Advanced module.

Let’s Revise!
What is ACL?
Select the right answer
`Alternate Control Log`
`Access Control List`
`Neither`

People trying to access information that was not meant for them to see are called ____:
Select the right answer
`Hawkers`

Select the right answer
`True`
`False`


(Lesson-9) Data Creation Today
(Topic-1) Applications of Big Data
Information Is Us
<comp_info.png>
Information Technology could be interpreted as the development of technology, in order to create, store, share and access information.
It makes information fun!
The Internet, obviously plays a dominant role in enabling this manipulation of information.
It makes information fun!

Everything Is Online
<comp_grill.png>
We spend a significant amount of our time online, often plugged in through more than 1 device.
As technology gets better, there has been an increase in devices too.
Most of us access our home WiFi from both our laptops and phones. Then we have tablets, smart TVs, etc.
All these devices are interacting with the Internet constantly.

Data Is Everywhere
<comp_internet_data.png>
All these devices connected together over the Internet, generate around 2.5 quintillion Bytes of data each day. (Translating to a LOT!!)
This generation of data happens by default as a part of the functioning of these devices.
Other than this, individuals all over the world are constantly creating data through social media, GPS and using various online services like Uber.
All of this data makes up the term Big Data.

4Vs Of Big Data
Big Data is recognizable instantly by the Vs. The 4Vs are the characteristics to look out for:
> Volume: Scale of Data
> Variety: Different forms of Data
> Velocity: Analysis of streaming Data
> Veracity: Uncertainty of Data
The Volume of Data is pretty easy to understand.
It simply means the large quantity of data, that is continuously being generated by all the devices that are connected to the network.

Variety In Big Data
Variety of Data refers to the different forms and formats of data.
For example, consider your cell phone service provider
1. Your mobile phone bill is expressed in currency.
2. The duration of the calls made from the device would be captured in minutes.
3. Every time you turn on your GPS, the geolocation is captured.
Playing around with all this data of different formats will tell your service provider whether you are likely to buy an international roaming pack from him or not.

Velocity Of Big Data
<comp_big_data.png>
Velocity is how quickly and seamlessly the data can be analysed and attached to a use case, all in real time.
Velocity Of Big Data, continued..
Consider this example:
You are an online clothes retailer and would like to announce a Christmas sale.
You have an emailer ready, listing discounts on warm clothing like jackets and scarves.
The mailing list is carefully made so as to not include anyone from Australia (They have summer in December, remember?)
Suddenly one of your customers from Germany, turns on his GPS, which shows he is in Sydney!
Your computer should be able to register this, and instantly exclude his name from the mailing list.

Veracity Of Big Data
Veracity or Quality of the data collected.
Not all the data collected may be good to use.
Let’s say your grandpa want to buy a cell phone. He decides to go to the Facebook pages of each company and then buy a phone from the company that has the most likes.
He reasons that the most popular company in terms of likes, must be the best and most trustworthy.
We know that this may not be the case as likes on a page may not be authentic and do not always signify a good product.
It is important to ascertain the source and quality of data before using it.

(Topic-2) Applications of Big Data
Big Data is the Baddest Wolf Around
<comp_big_data_connection.png>
More than the amount of data we produce, what blew people’s minds is, what we could do with all this data.
This explosively large data phenomenon is called Big Data.
This intriguing, elusive and sometimes frustrating Big Data has changed our lives forever.

Netflix as an Example
A Simple example, is that of Netflix.
Netflix record all the interactions that its users have with the application. It then analyses it to answer questions like
> What kind of content are users liking most?
> What genre is popular with each gender?
> What is the perfect mix for the perfect show?
Answers to these questions are implemented on the application, resulting in users going back again and again giving more revenue to Netflix.
Thank You Big Data!

Google and Uber Examples
Google undertook an exercise with the U.S. Centre for Disease Control, providing the regions where Flu topics were searched most, helping to predict where an epidemic may break out next.
Companies like Uber have models built on big data where they use locations of customers along with that of drivers to provide their services .

Amazon Example
Another simple example is that of online marketplaces like Amazon.com
They alter process of the products on a real time scale based on the demand for them.
Many Retailers combine data from their loyalty program with online behaviour of their customers to target more offers to them.

Big Data is Daunting
<comp_big_data_daunting.png>
Big Data is clearly something that companies must sink their teeth into.
So why is it that many of them have not?
Big Data is daunting for the uninitiated.

Challenges
Big Data poses 3 major challenges:
1. Storage: Since the quantity of data is large, huge servers are required to store it.
2. Various sources:. The data that is collected in various formats needs to be unified for a comparative analysis.
3. Not just space, the data transfer speed needs to be ramped up. If it isn’t, the system will remain slow and ineffective.
The solution to this is Hadoop. This is a framework that allows parallel storage and analysis. At the same time, it can accept various formats and structures of data and all this, in large volumes.

See You Next Time!
In this unit we learnt what big data is, what defines it and how it is useful.
There are many case studies on this topic and they really do make interesting, extra reading!
Big Data will be covered in the Advanced module in greater detail.

(Lesson-10) Important Buzzwords In IT
(Topic-1) Need to Understand Buzzwords
Why Do We Need To Understand Buzzwords?
Hey there!
After going through the 9 units so far, we have learnt about the foundations of IT.
However, while beginning to learn any subject, it is important to keep the latest developments in sight.
It is amazing how this field has grown, giving us mind boggling miracles constantly, plus, knowing this is going to make you sound pretty smart ;)
Plus, knowing this is going to make you sound pretty smart ;)

Let’s Jump In
<comp_trend.png>
Let’s go through some terms and concepts that are the emerging trends of the industry.
Get ready to widen your horizons!

(Topic-2) Explaining The Buzzwords
Artificial Intelligence
<comp_ai.png>
Artificial Intelligence is the intelligent behaviour of software that can take decisions and improve over time by learning from experience.
Examples of its application are software like Alexa and Cortana.
Uber is teaming up with Mercedes Benz to create a self-driving Mercedes.
Complex Big Data applications also, are examples of artificial intelligence.
Artificial Intelligence example and idea is to do something like above.

BlockChain
The Blockchain, can be simply described as a complete list of transactions.
Consider the below steps in the case of a Bitcoin transaction:
Thus it is difficult to forge or perform fraudulent transactions, since the network is private and each transaction public to all the members of that network.

BlockChain Continued
Consider the below steps in case of a Bitcoin transaction:
1. A user requests a transaction.
2. The request is broadcasted across the network.
3. The network validates the user’s status and authenticity.
4. Once verified, a fresh entry is made in the list of transactions, i.e a new block is added.
5. The transaction is complete.
Each block or entry is permanent and unalterable.

Serverless Architecture
This is a service offered by technological service providers like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, etc.
It provides a way for software developers to create their code without having to maintain servers.
They can change usage from one server to multiple, within minutes.
They only need to pay for as much as they use. This is much more convenient than buying servers and risking underutilization.
Yeah! It’s pretty neat!

Mobile First
<comp_mobile_first.png>
This one is pretty simple.
It refers to the trend of increasing usage of cellphones to perform all functions of a laptop or desktop computer.

Mobile First Continued
<comp_mobile_first.png>
Mobile phones nowadays are very powerful and using them for transactions like online shopping, banking, etc. has become a norm.
Being Mobile First, means that a company must make sure that their websites and applications are compatible with laptops, desktops and mobiles alike, in order to grow their business.

Dark Data
<comp_darkdata.png>
Have you ever been in a meeting, taken your own notes for ‘later’ and never looked at them again?
That ‘Later’ is not likely to come, but you still hold on to them.

Dark Data Continued
Companies do this with data too!
Data of customers that was useful years ago, or just about every kind of data about the customer, may not be helpful today, but is still stored taking up valuable company resources.
This comparatively useless data is called `Dark Data`.
Dark Data must be eliminated, for the company to control costs and run an efficient data center.

Internet Of Things
<comp_iot.png>
With the Internet of Things, the physical world will become one big information system.
Multiple devices today are connected to the Internet and can communicate with other devices such as your phone, or amongst each other.
These include mobile devices, wearables, consumer and home electronic devices, automotive and environmental devices.

Internet Of Things Continued
The new focus of technology will be to design a user experience out of a network of such devices, creating an Internet connected form of reality.
A wonderful application of this is shown in the movie ‘Her’ directed by Spike Jonze.
Makes a great watch!

Actionable/Self Service Analytics
<comp_service_analytics.png>
Much of the analysis of data in the past has been retrospective.
Data was collected, say, during the summer of 2007, analysed and then the outcomes were implemented in the summer of 2008.
Now the business need is to collect data, and analyse it instantly, so that insights from it can be used instantly.

Actionable/Self Service Analytics Continued.
The trick is to have computer systems configured in such a way so as to make this possible.

Let’s Go Over Some Questions
All of the buzzwords discussed are complex and entail long discssions.
This was an effort to sum them up, but do go ahead and read our other, more detailed, material to get a better picture.
Before that, let’s answer a few questions.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) means:
Select the right answer
`A robot`
`A software program involving machine learning and decision making logic`
`Both of the above`

Blockchain is a secure method of transacting here each transaction is recorded:
Select the right answer
`True`
`False`

Dark Data is relevant and useful information:
Select the right answer
`True`
`False`

The internet of things (IOT) is:
Select the right answer
`A separate network of all gadgets`
`Parts of the internet that are not controlled by humans`
`The interaction of all gadgets with the Internet, resulting in generation of huge amounts of data`

Conclusion
<bye.png>
That was great! Well done!
This brings us to the end of our module. We hope you enjoyed our course and have learnt some new things too!
Remember, this is only the beginning. There’s lot more to learn and discover in the vast and exciting world of Information Technology
Hope to see you soon!
