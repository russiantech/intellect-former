(Lesson-1) Let's Get Started
(Topic-1) Introduction
Programming Basics
<get_dirty.png>
Time to get our hands dirty!
Let's dig into the world of Programming!

<comp_do.png>
Computers are pretty dumb, they literally have no brains!
Then how do computers work?
Say thanks to Programming! That's how we make the computer do cool stuff for us.
Psst: Don't be that guy in the image ;)

Which of the following do you think a computer is capable of doing?
Select the right answer
`Complex calculations`
`Write a poem`
`Generate ideas`
`Think on its own`

(Topic-2) Problem solving test
<solve.png>
What if we could get computers to solve problems for us?
Well, we are about to learn just that!
Programming lets us solve problems by giving instructions to computers!

What are the steps in solving a problem?
`Drag & rearrange in the appropriate order`
`Define the problem`
`Plan the steps for solution`
`Break the problem into smaller parts and analyze`
`Implement the solution`

(Topic-3) Programs
<programming_everywhere.png>
Beware! Programs are everywhere, it's an integral part of our life now.
This app you are using right now is a program, and so is your alarm clock and digital watch.
We spend 80% of our time interacting with different programs.

Which of the following are examples of programs?
Select one or more answers
`Operating systems`
`Mobile apps`
`Desktop/Laptop applications`
`Web browsers`

Sequence
<sequence.png>
Ever thought that all the tasks we do are based on a sequence of steps?
Eg: Feeling hungry? Your steps:
> Open the fridge
> Get food out
> Close the fridge
> Eat the food!
Tadaaa! Done!
We use a similar sequence of logical steps in programming.

Which of the following tasks require you to follow a sequence of steps?
Select one or more answers
`Writing a computer program`
`Washing clothes`
`Workout in gym`
`Making a cake`

If you were to make a burger, what would be the steps?
Drag & rearrange in the appropriate order
`Place patty and veggies over a bun`
`Place the other bun over the 1st bun`
`Take 2 buns`

(Topic-4) Summary
To Summarise
<work.png>
> Computers work using programs.
> Programs are sequence of instructions.
> Programming is solving a problem with steps of instructions.
You have mastered the Let's Get Started course!
Keep up your new achievement!

(Lesson-2) Storage
(Topic-1) Introduction _ Storage
Storing Information
<forgot.png>
Humans Forget!
Computers don't!!
Let's put that memory to good use by learning how to store information in computers.
Remember what you had yesterday for breakfast?
No?
Don't worry, computers never forget anything if they're told to remember.
We are about to learn how to use this superpower of infinite memory.
Let us try telling the computer to remember our name
Hey computer:
Remember (_____) as my name
Displays my name `Chris` if you entered `Chris`.

(Topic-2) Asking the computer to remember

Let us try telling the computer to remember our name
Hey computer:
Remember `"Chris"` as my name
Display my name
`Chris`
The computer will remember this name until we tell it to store a different name.
Psst: these instructions are oversimplified, but we’ll get to actual computer-language soon

(Topic-3) Variables
<var_box.png>
To remember things, computers use memory boxes called variables.
Like boxes, variables have a label and store content in them.
If you wanted to store an animal in a variable(box):
Hey computer: 
Remember `"sloth"` as `my_pet` 
Display `my_pet`

Select one or more answers
`The label of variable is my_pet`
`The content of the variable is sloth`
`That’s not a variable at all`

Uh Oh! In computer language, labels have to be single letters or single words, which disqualifies “my pet” as a valid label.
Can you find the valid label?
Select the right answer
`010101`
`My_Pet`
`My Pet`
`1947`

Can variables change values? Let’s find out:
Hey computer:
Remember "Rock Johnson" as `my_name`
Remember "(______)" as `my_name`
Display `my_name`;
Output: `whatever_name_entered`

Continue
Usually, we need to store different kinds or types of information. Most used information types are words and numbers.
Which of the following make sense?
Select one or more answers
`Subtract 1 year from my_pet`
`Add 1 year to my_birthday`
`Add “Dog” to my_pet`


(Topic-4) Changing values
Can variables change values?
Let’s find out
Hey computer!
Remember `"John"` as `my_name`
Remember `"Rock"` as `my_name`
Display my_name
`Rock`

As we saw here, the variables are capable of changing values as the program runs, which is why we can use variables to assign values and keep track of things.

(Topic-5) Using variables
Numbers + computers is a great combo to carry out arithmetic tasks.
Hey computer
Remember `10` as `my_number`
Add `50` to `my_number`
Subtract `10` from `my_number`
Multiply `my_number` by `3`
Divide `my_number` by `5`
Display result`
`30`
Even if we were mathematicians, it would be hard to beat the speed and accuracy of computers.

(Topic-6) Storing Text
Unlike numbers, words(also called Strings), have quotation marks around them and can’t be used for arithmetic. They’re still useful.
Hey computer:
Remember `my_pet` as `"Dog"`
Add `"Cat"` to `my_pet`
Display `my_pet`
Select the right answer
`DogCat`
`Dog Cat`

(Topic-7) Lists
As we saw, variables are like boxes which store values. What if we want to store multiple values?
This is where we use boxes with space to store multiple values: also called lists.
Hey computer:
> Create a list
> Add `“Dog”` to the list
> Add `"Pug"` to the list
> Display list
`Dog Pug`
Notice that? Lists are suitable to store multiple values, particularly when they are of the same type.

(Topic-8) Summary
What are variables?
Select the right answer
`They are memory boxes with labels`
`Computers use them to store and remember stuff`
`They can change their values`
`All of the above`


(Lesson-3) Repeating ThingsIntroduction
(Topic-1) Introduction
<repeat.png>
How many times have you repeatedly done a task?
Not too many times, right? It’s gonna get boring!
But hey! Computers can repeat stuff over and over again and never get bored.
Let’s look at how we can make computer repeat tasks for us:
Ok computer:
Repeat 5 times:
Display "Awesome!"
`Awesome!` `Awesome!` `Awesome!` `Awesome!` `Awesome!`
It would take a lot of time and effort to perform repetitive tasks if computers couldn’t repeat them for us.

(Topic-2) Where to use repeat?
Imagine you wanted to prepare a burger for your friend. Sounds simple, but then it requires a few repetitive steps. Get 4 buns Put the vegetables on bun 1 Put the vegetables on bun2 Put chicken on bun 3 Put chicken on bun 4 How would you complete the burger?
Select the right answer
`Place bun 1 and 3 over each otherPlace bun 2 and 4 over each other`
`Place bun 1 and 2 over each otherPlace bun 3 and 4 over each other`

Let’s actually make 20 burgers, with a shortcut ;)
Drag & rearrange in the appropriate order
`Put chicken on 2nd bun`
`Repeat 20 times:`
`Get 2 buns`
`Put vegetables on 1st bun`
`Place the bun over each other`


(Topic-3) Loops
This repetition of steps is known as loops.
As a computer programmer, you should be able to identify repetitive tasks and wrap them up in loops.
Which of the following do you think are repetitive tasks?
Select the right answer
`Adding marks of all students in class`
`Counting 1 to 100`
`Creating a beautiful drawing of a landscape`

In many situations, you might have to repeat a particular task set number of times.
`Repeat for 50 students`
`Get the mark sheet`
`Add individual subject marks`
`Display the total marks`
See how you can use count based loops when you know exactly how many times the loop has to be repeated.

(Topic-4) While Loop
If you don’t know how many times a sequence has to be repeated?
Don’t worry, in such situations we use the `until-condition` loop or `while-condition` loop
Counting the balls in a bag is an example:
1. `Open the bag`
2. `Repeat until the bag is empty`
3. `Put your hand in the bag`
4. `Draw one ball out`
The until loop or while loop is condition-controlled loops which repeat till the condition is reached.

(Topic-5) Summary
Summary
<summary.jpg>
Repetitive tasks can be handled better by using Loops.
Loops can have fixed number of repetitions.
Loops can have conditional number of repetitions(until a condition is met).

(Lesson-4) Making Decisions 
(Topic-1) Introduction
Decision Making
<decision_0.jpg>
Can computers make decisions for us?
Remember we learned computers can’t think?
So we also have to tell the computer what decisions to make!
Psst: Unlike an unruly child, computers obey and act according to your decisions ;)

Computers have to be told to take decisions based on conditions.
Which of the following conditions can help you decide if you should drink water?
Select one or more answers
`You are thirsty`
`Your throat is feeling dry`
`You did not drink water for a long time`
`You had a bath`

(Topic-2) Using If..Then..Else
Computers use simple words such as if and then to guide their actions.
Ok Computer
if time is After 8 pm
`Then` display `"Good Night"`
That was simple and pretty easy, right?
Conditions help the computer decided what action to perform and when.
Now what if a condition is not met?
In such situations, we use the word `else`

If time is after 8pm
`Then` display `"Good night"`
`Else` display `"Good day"`

This ability to perform different actions in different situations is what makes the computers look smart.

These conditions make the programs more intelligent.
Let’s take an example of preparing `veg` and `nonveg` burgers using `If and Then`.

Ok Computer
`IF` you want Veg Burger:
`THEN` put vegetables
IF you want Non-Veg Burger:
`THEN` put chicken
See how conditions make things much easier and intelligent!

Have you ever thought why we need these if and else that we call conditions?
Select the right answer
`They make the programs more intelligent`
`They are based on the situation`
`Computers are able to decide actions based on these conditions`
`All of the above`

(Topic-3) Using Else If
What if you also had to take care of alternate scenarios?
Then you must use the mighty else if.
If you want to choose between veg, non-veg and Egg Burgers, how would you do this?
OK computer
`If` you want Veg Burger
	`Then` add vegetables
`Else` if you want Non-Veg Burger
	`Then` add chicken
`Else` add Egg
You are already getting the hang of this, aren’t you?

Have you ever thought why we need these if and else that we call conditions?
Select the right answer
`They make the programs more intelligent`
`They are based on the situation`
`Computers are able to decide actions based on these conditions`
`All of the above`

(Topic-4) Summary
<decision_0.jpg>
> Computers can't decide for themselves.
> We help the computers decide by creating conditions based on situations.
> These conditions make the programs seem intelligent.
> Programs with conditions help computers perform the right actions in the right situations.

(Lesson-5) Creating Lists
(Topic-1) How to store multiple values
<animated_vars.gif>
We have learned how to store values...
But how do we store multiple values?
Well we can simply create a list of values!
Just like we create a list of items to buy before we go shopping! As easy as that!

Let us first examine if we can store multiple values(vegetable names) in a single variable.
Tap the correct answer to fill in the blankss
Hey Computer:
Remember `"Cucumber"` as vegetable
Remember `"Spinach"` as vegetable
Remember `"Carrot"` as vegetable
Display  _________
`vegetable`

Instead of having three variables that store single vegetable, we can make a list that holds all the vegetables.
Tap the correct answer to fill in the blanks
Hey Computer:
Create a _______ of my_vegetables.
`list`
Remember `"Cucumber"` as my_vegetables
Remember `"Spinach"` as my_vegetables
Remember `"Carrot"` as my_vegetables

Display my_vegetables
Tap the correct answer to fill in the blanks
So which of the following values can be better put in a list?
Select the right answer
Area of a circle
Bag of 20 oranges
Names of your 10 best friends

(Topic-2) Summary
<summary.jpg>
TO SUMMARISE:
Lists are used to store a set of related values.
Items of the list can be sorted, rearranged, replaced and removed.
You can perform tasks on each item of the list together at once.

(Lesson-6) Grouping Instructions
(Topic-1) Similar instructions
Similar instructions
<similar_instruct.png>
There are a few activities that we do daily!Such as Brushing, Bathing, Eating breakfast and more.
These activities follow similar set of sequence and are repeatedly performed in similar ways.
Ever wondered if we could get them done in just one step?
Unfortunately, real life doesn't allow us a shortcut. But hey, computer world does!
We are about to find out how...

Can you find out tasks that are repeated and follow similar steps?
Select the right answer
`Travelling to a new place`
`Taking a bath`
`Drawing a new painting`

Well, programs as well contain parts that are repeated many times.
Eg: What happens when you copy and paste text?
Select the right answer
`Store the text in memory & paste the text`
`Delete the text & save the file`

(Topic-2) Create group of instructions
For the computer to bundle/group an activity or set of instructions, we need to tell the computer what the procedure should be called and what it should do.
Hey computer:
Remember the selected text and paste the selected text is _________?
Tap the correct answer to fill in the blanks
`Delete`
`Copy & Paste`

Almost everything we tell the computer to do(`such as even copy & paste`) is actually a group of instructions which we also call predefined procedure.
Hey computer:
Create a list of `my_inspirations`
add `“Mark Z”`, `“Bill G”`, and `“Steve J”` to `my_inspirations`
Bill G, Mark Z, Steve J
Aha! You just made the computer create a list and sort it for you.

Now let us make the computer remember sorting in `alphabetical order` and `displaying` it using stored group of instructions
Hey computer:

remember as `sort_and_display`:
sort `my_inspirations` in alphabetical order

Hey computer:
Create a list of `my_inspirations`
add `“Mark Z”`, `“Bill G”`, and `“Steve J”` to `my_inspirations`

sort_and_display:
display `my_inspirations`
`Bill G`, `Mark Z`, `Steve J`

Here you saw how you can define a sequence of steps and reuse it when required.

(Topic-3) Procedures & Functions
Procedures & Functions
You may use procedures to remember steps and perform when required.
Similarly, we use functions when we want to:
1. Provide input to the procedures.
2. Display result from the procedures.
In a nutshell, procedures perform a task, while functions produce a result.

What is the difference between procedures and functions?
Select the right answer
`Procedures can be called only once but not functions`
`Procedures perform a task while functions also return a value`
`Procedures make the program shorter while functions make it longer`

(Topic-4) Let's revise
<summary.jpg>
TO SUMMARISE:
> Group of similar instructions are written together and stored as procedures or functions.
> Procedures and functions are used to make the programs reusable and shorter.
> Functions can display the result while procedures can only carry out the tasks.

(Lesson-7) Avoiding Mistakes
(Topic-1) What are mistakes?
What are mistakes?
<mistakes.png>
Here’s a good news for you: Computers don’t make mistakes!
Here’s a bad news for you: Humans like us can tell the computer what to do and cause mistakes!
Imagine your bank program making a mistake and removing your account balance! Nightmare! Isn’t it?
Hence, we are about to learn how to make computers avoid mistakes…

Mistakes or bugs can cause a program to show unexpected results or sometimes make the computer stop working!

Hey computer:
remember 10 as `my_number`
repeat until `my_number` is less than 9
Add 1 to `my_number`
Then display `my_number`
`Not responding…`

Because `my_number` will never be less than 9, the program will never display the output and get into an infinite loop

(Topic-2) What is debugging?
Debugging simply means finding and correcting the bugs. It is an important part of programming. Can you spot the bug in this program?

Hey computer:
remember `“Dog”` as `my_pet`
add `“Cat”` to `my_pet`
display `my pet`
Select the right answer
`No bugs`
`Yes, bug in display my pet`
`Yes, bug in “Dog” as my_pet`

(Topic-3) Logic bug
Sometimes, programs have logic bug, so the program doesn't crash, but does not give the desired result.
Can you find the bug in this program?

Hey computer:
Remember 30 as `my_age`
If `my_age` is above 35
Display `“your offer is 35%”`

If `my_age` is below 25 
Display `“your offer 25%”`

Select the right answer
`Yes, no check for age between 25 and 35`
`No, it’s bug free`
`Yes, there’s a typo error`

(Topic-4) Avoiding bug
When programs become longer and complex, their instructions become harder to read. How can we avoid mistakes and understand it better?
Select the right answer
`By encrypting the code`
`By providing comments to understand the code better`
`By removing the lines of code to make it short`

Why should we carry a series of tests before releasing a program?
Select the right answer
`Because there might be critical bugs in the program`
`Because testing is fun`
`Because while testing we learn what the user feels`

When you press space bar, the text moves to the next line What kind of bug this might be?
Select the right answer
`Syntax Bug`
`Logic Bug`
`Debugging`

(Topic-5) Summary
Summary
<summary.jpg>
Mistakes in programs are called bugs.
Debugging is the process of finding bugs in a program.
Bugs are usually logic or syntax based.
Bugs can be avoided by commenting, using proper names and testing the program.

(Lesson-8) Using Computer Language
(Topic-1) What is a computer language?
What is a computer language?
<comp_language.png>
So far we have learned computers are great if they are given correct instructions.
However, there is a problem which we have not talked about.
What could that be? Let’s find out!

We haven't talked about what languages do computers speak.
Which of the following is true?
Select the right answer
`Computers don’t remember stuff`
`Computers don’t understand our natural languages`
`Computers can’t repeat things`

If computers don’t understand the natural languages we speak, then how do we get them to do tasks for us?
Select the right answer
`Programming languages`
`Precise instructions in english`

Which of the following do you think a computer programming language is?
Select the right answer
`A communication aid between you and your computer`
`Some sort of alien language`
`Language that programmers speak`
`Computer’s brain`

(Topic-2) Converting code to 0s and 1s
Converting code to 0s and 1s
<robots.png>
Wait a minute, Programming languages are not 0s and 1s. But computers understand only 0s and 1s!
How does a computer understand a programming language?
This is where a compiler comes to the rescue!
Compiler converts Programming language to 0s and 1s which the computer understands.

Which of the following tasks do you think a compiler does?
Select the right answer
`Compilers are an aid to communicate with computer`
`Compilers convert the programming language into 0s and 1s`
`Compilers are used to build logic for solving tasks`
`Compiler? Never hear of it!`

(Topic-3) Understanding code
What do we call instructions written in a programming language?
Select the right answer
`Source code`
`Debugging`
`Crash reporting`
`Comments`

There are many programming languages used for different purposes! Let us try a simple and powerful programming language called python.
My_name = __________?
`enter your own name`
print(My_name)

How about storing a list of items in python?
`fruits=[]` 
`fruits.append('Apple')` 
`fruits.append('Mango')` 
`fruits.append('Orange')` 
`print(fruits)`
`Apple, Mango, Orange`

That’s how you would store and display a list in python.

Let us try making decisions in Python, what will the code display?

`marks = 50` 
`if` marks < 35:
	print 'You have failed' 
`else`:
	print 'You have passed'

Select the right answer
`You have failed!`
`You have passed!`

(Topic-4) Let’s revise
Phew! We have learned a lot about programming! Let’s conclude with a final quiz!

What’s true about programming languages?
Select one or more answers

`In the end, compiler translates them into machine language`
`Java is the only programming language`
`We use them because computers don't know natural language`
`They help us communicate with the computer`

Summary
- Programming Language is a communication aid between you and the computer.
- Compiler converts the programming language into 0s and 1s which computer understands.
- Source code is the instructions written in a programming language.
- A variety of programming languages are used for various purposes.

Amazing Progress!
You have now mastered Programming Fundamentals!
But this is just the beginning of awesomeness!

Now you are prepared to take more courses in Programming languages such as Java, Python, C++ and much more!

Write the code, change the world!
